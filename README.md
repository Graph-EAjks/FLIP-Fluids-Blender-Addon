Want to try the FLIP Fluids addon before buying the [full marketplace product](https://github.com/rlguy/Blender-FLIP-Fluids/wiki/Official-Marketplaces-of-the-FLIP-Fluids-Addon)? Try out the **FLIP Fluids Demo** addon! The FLIP Fluids demo can do everything that the full version can and will let you create, run, and render your own fluid simulations with a small limitation.

### Limitations

- Simulation meshes are watermarked with _FLIP Fluids Demo_ text
