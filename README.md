Want to try FLIP Fluids addon before buying the full [Blender Market Product](https://blendermarket.com/products/flipfluids)? Try out the **[FLIP Fluids Demo](https://github.com/rlguy/Blender-FLIP-Fluids/wiki/FLIP-Fluids-Demo-Addon)** addon! The FLIP Fluids Demo will let you create, run, and render your own fluid simulations with a few small limitations.

### Limitations

- Simulation meshes are watermarked with _FLIP Fluids Demo_ text

### Getting Started

After downloading the demo addon, follow our [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/rlguy/Blender-FLIP-Fluids/wiki/Addon-Installation-and-Uninstallation). The instructions are similar to installing any other Blender addon.
